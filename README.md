# Note

Please note that these slides were targeted towards people who had been out of touch with math for a long time. My intention was to distil the essence of the 
subject (esp. in the slides for an introduction to ML). The slides for ML basics were hastily prepared with only the ongoing project at that time in mind, so 
not all areas within ML are discussed. The slides were of course accompanied by verbal interaction and detailed discussion.
